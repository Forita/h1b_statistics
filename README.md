# h1b_statistics
A newspaper editor was researching immigration data trends on H1B(H-1B, H-1B1, E-3) visa application processing over the past years, trying to identify the occupations and states with the most number of approved H1B visas. She has found statistics available from the US Department of Labor and its Office of Foreign Labor Certification Performance Data. But while there are ready-made reports for 2018 and 2017, the site doesnâ€™t have them for past years.

In this repo, we create a mechanism to analyze past years data, specificially calculate two metrics: Top 10 Occupations and Top 10 States for certified visa applications.
